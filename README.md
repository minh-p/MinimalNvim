# Minh's minimal Neovim config.
## Preamble
* A lot of people says why the hell I keep configing my tools.
* I have no idea either.
* I have a pretty rounded config already but it doesn't feel good as I use so many plugins.
* I want to use as little as plugins possible in this config.
* You know, probably the minimal it would get is just a colorscheme.
	* It's gonna be full feature though: with nvim-lsp and other stuff that is not about looking cool.
